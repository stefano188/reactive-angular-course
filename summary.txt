# start angular app
npm start

in package.json under "script" sections, "start" script is defined
"start": "./node_modules/.bin/ng serve  --proxy-config ./proxy.json",

proxy.json is
{
  "/api": {
    "target": "http://localhost:9000",
    "secure": false
  }
}
every call to
    htt://localhost:4200/api/...   (where angular app is deployed)
is mapped to  
    http://localhost:9000/api/...  (where server is deployed)
